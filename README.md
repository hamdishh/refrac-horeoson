# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Description
This project involves the modification of a marketing agency's wwebsite's codebase in order for it to be easily accessible for future engagements by clients and staff.
Many of these adjustments made the website alot more accessible to all users including the elderly disabled who may struggle immensely when it comes to using the internet and technology in general. For example originally the search bar was harder to access so i had to add in nav classes in order to bring the navbar to the top of the page where it was easily in sight for all users to utilise.


### Code Highlights/ What i learnt during the challenge
Personally a code highlight of mine would be using the <aside> element which i found rather useful in order to achieve positioning the icons and text within it to the side of the main text in the section element. It was really useful for spacing and making the webpage alot neater. I also got to read up on w3schools on the difference between <section> and <article> elements. Articles would be more specific to independent content whereas sections would be needed for a section within a document.
